# Met Museum Tools

About the files in this directory:
- `prefetchMetApi` and `parseApiResponses` slowly pre-fetch the API responses from met-museum and then after parsing update the records in the database for future use.
- `objectImages.list` is a list of pairs of object ids and primary image links for each object
